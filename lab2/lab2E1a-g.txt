1) Assume that the Enrollment Table is as follows (Table is not pictured here though)

a) We denote the set of all attributes of Enrollment by Attr(Enrollment). Write Attr(Enrollment).
Attr(Enrollment) = {sID, cID}

b) What is the cardinality of Attr(Enrollment)?
|Attr(Enrollment)| = 2

c) What is the cardinality of Enrollment?
|Enrollment| = 8

d) Write Enrollment as a relation
Enrollment := {(23929340, BIOL101), (23929340, PHIL101), (23929340, MATH101), (23929340, CHEM102), (21921015, MATH101), (21921015, CHEM102), (21921015, PHIL102), (01028190, MATH307)}

e) What is Enrollment's predicate?
The student with sID x is enrolled in cID y; where (x, y) is an element of studentID x courseID

f) Give an example of a tuple that turns the predicate into a True statement.
The student with sID 23929340 is enrolled in cID BIOL101 (This is true).

g) Give an example of a tuple that turns the predicate into a False statement.
The student with sID 01028190 is enrolled in cID BIOL101 (This is not true).
